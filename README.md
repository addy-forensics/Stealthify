# Stealthify
The Perfect Steganography Solution

This is a simple steganography tool written in Python using Tkinter for the graphical user interface and the PIL (Python Imaging Library) for image manipulation. The program is designed to encode a secret message into an image file, either in the PNG, JPG, or JPEG format, and decode a hidden message from an image.
The GUI elements to be implemented are a text entry, encode/decode buttons, and methods for handling the operations. The encode_message method calls user input message, asks for an image file, and encodes the message into the image using the least significant bit technique. The decode_message method asks for an image file and extracts the hidden message from it.

The entire code performs a basic implementation of steganography functionality to hide and retrieve messages in images.
